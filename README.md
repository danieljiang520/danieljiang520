## Hi there 👋

![danieljiang520's github stats](https://github-readme-stats-sigma-five.vercel.app/api?username=danieljiang520&count_private=true)

Hi! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Music at the University of Michigan. I enjoy making 3D modeling GUIs and working in robotics and autonomous systems.

#### Something about me
As you can guess from my avatar, I love every possible activity related to basketball, whether it is stats analytics, watching NBA and FIBA, or playing in the instramural league in school. I was born in Toronto, Canada and lived in Beijing and Shanghai during my elementary education. Then, I moved back to Toronto for middle and high school and finally ended up in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
