### Hi there 👋

![danieljiang520's github stats](https://github-readme-stats-sigma-five.vercel.app/api?username=danieljiang520&count_private=true)

Hi, my name is Daniel and I am pursuing an M.S. in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, expecting to graduate in March 2026. I previously graduated summa cum laude from the University of Michigan with a B.S.E. in Computer Engineering and double minors in Mathematics and Music. I enjoy making 3D modeling GUIs and working on robotics and autonomous systems.

#### Something about me
I love about every activity related to basketball&mdash;playing, watching, and talking about it. I also enjoy playing music, skiing, playing poker, and exploring new cities. I have been an avid car enthusiast for as long as I can remember, and I am interested in enhancing safety and system robustness in complex and autonomous engineering systems.

🔭 Some of the projects I've worked on
- :dog: [Simba](https://github.com/danieljiang520/Simba) - a multi-purpose GUI for processing 3D kinect scan files and LS-DYNA models
- 🏎️ [LSDYNA K_parser](https://github.com/danieljiang520/K_parser) - a Python library for dealing with LS-DYNA key files
- :rocket: [MRover](https://github.com/umrover/mrover-workspace) - the main repository for the Michigan Mars Rover Team
- :earth_americas: [UMTRI 3D GUI](https://github.com/danieljiang520/UMTRI_3DGUI) - an expandable GUI framework for 3D mesh visualization and editing
