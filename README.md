### Hi there 👋

![danieljiang520's github stats](https://github-readme-stats-sigma-five.vercel.app/api?username=danieljiang520&count_private=true)

Hi! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Music at the University of Michigan. I enjoy making 3D modeling GUIs and working in robotics and autonomous systems.

#### Something about me
As you can guess from my avatar, I love about every activity related to basketball, whether it is statistical analysis (my most recent favorite projection model is [DARKO](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/DARKO//)), watching the NBA and FIBA, and playing in the university intramural league. I enjoy playing music in an orchestra and with friends, skiing, playing poker and any card games, and exploring new cities. I was born in Toronto, Canada, and lived in Beijing and Shanghai during my elementary education. Then, I moved back to Toronto for middle and high school before finally ending up in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
