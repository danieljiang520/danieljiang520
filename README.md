### Hi there 👋

![danieljiang520's github stats](https://github-readme-stats-sigma-five.vercel.app/api?username=danieljiang520&count_private=true)

Hi! I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Music at the University of Michigan. I enjoy making 3D modeling GUIs and working in robotics and autonomous systems.

#### Something about me
As you can guess from my avatar, I love about every activity related to basketball, whether it is statistical analysis (my most recent favorite projection model is [DARKO](https://apanalytics.shinyapps.io/DARKO//)), watching the NBA and FIBA, and playing in the university intramural league. Besides basketball, I enjoy playing music in an orchestra and with friends, skiing, playing poker, and exploring new cities. I have been an avid car enthusiast for as long as I can remember, and I am interested in enhancing safety and system robustness in complex and autonomous engineering systems. I was born in Toronto, Canada, and lived in Beijing and Shanghai during my elementary education. Then, I moved back to Toronto for middle and high school before finally ending up in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

🔭 Some of the projects I've worked on:
- :dog: [Simba](https://github.com/danieljiang520/Simba) - a multi-purpose GUI for processing 3D kinect scan files and LS-DYNA models
- 🏎️ [LSDYNA K_parser](https://github.com/danieljiang520/K_parser) - a Python library for dealing with LS-DYNA key files
- :rocket: [MRover](https://github.com/umrover/mrover-workspace) - the main repository for the Michigan Mars Rover Team
- :earth_americas: [UMTRI 3D GUI](https://github.com/danieljiang520/UMTRI_3DGUI) - an expandable GUI framework for 3D mesh visualization and editing
